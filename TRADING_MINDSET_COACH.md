# Trading Mindset Coach - AI-Powered Psychological Analysis

## Overview

The Trading Mindset Coach is an advanced AI system that analyzes your trading behavior to identify psychological patterns and provide personalized coaching. It implements the concepts of data labeling, psychological pattern detection, and interactive coaching.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Cleaning and Labeling System

The system automatically analyzes each trade and labels it with psychological patterns:

- **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**: Detects trades made from fear of missing opportunities
- **Revenge Trading**: Identifies trades made to recover from recent losses
- **Fear of Execution**: Spots trades where execution anxiety affected decision-making
- **Overconfidence**: Detects trades made with excessive confidence
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Identifies over-analysis leading to missed opportunities

### 2. Psychological Pattern Detection

The AI analyzes your trading data to identify recurring psychological patterns:

```typescript
// Example pattern detection
{
  id: 'pattern-fomo',
  label: 'FOMO',
  description: 'You\'ve made 5 trades driven by Fear of Missing Out, with 40% win rate and â‚¹-200 average P&L.',
  confidence: 0.8,
  frequency: 5,
  impact: 'negative',
  triggers: ['Price gaps', 'Social media alerts', 'News events'],
  symptoms: ['Quick entries without analysis', 'Emotional trading notes']
}
```

### 3. Trading Mindset Coaching Questions

The system generates personalized coaching questions based on detected patterns:

#### FOMO Pattern Questions:
- "What triggered your FOMO trade today? Was it price movement, news, or social media?"
- "How did you feel when you saw the price moving without you?"
- "What would have happened if you missed this trade?"

#### Revenge Trading Questions:
- "What triggered your revenge trade today? Are you trying to recover from recent losses?"
- "How did you feel after your recent losses?"
- "How can you prevent revenge trading in the future?"

#### Fear of Execution Questions:
- "What emotion are you trading from: fear or confidence? What's preventing confident execution?"
- "What specific fears are holding you back?"
- "How did you feel when your plan got invalidated?"

### 4. Interactive Coaching System

Users can respond to coaching questions and receive personalized insights:

```typescript
// Example user response processing
const insights = analytics.processCoachResponse('fomo-trigger', 
  'I saw the price gap up and felt like I was missing out on profits');

// Generated insights:
// - "Your response indicates some emotional challenges. Consider taking a trading break to reset."
// - "FOMO is a common trading challenge. Remember: there are always more opportunities."
```

### 5. Behavioral Analysis Dashboard

- **Risk Tolerance Profile**: Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive
- **Emotional Stability Score**: Percentage based on consistency and decision quality
- **Confidence Correlation**: How well your confidence aligns with actual performance
