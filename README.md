## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-journal.git
   cd trading-journal
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/trading_journal"
   
   # Authentication
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
   
   # API Security
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

4. Set up the database
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Database Configuration

The application is configured to use PostgreSQL by default. The schema includes:
- Optimized indexes for query performance
- Support for options and futures trading
- Comprehensive trade tracking fields

To switch between databases:
- **PostgreSQL** (recommended for production): Set `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file
- **SQLite** (for local development only): Update `prisma/schema.prisma` datasource

## Production Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
# Install production dependencies
npm ci --production

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Build the application
npm run build:prod
```

### Start the Production Server

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Deployment Options

- **Netlify**: Connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments
- **Docker**: A Dockerfile is provided for containerized deployments
- **Traditional Hosting**: Deploy the built application to any Node.js hosting service

## Project Maintenance

### Cleaning Build Artifacts

To keep your project directory size manageable, you can clean up build artifacts:

```bash
# Clean the Next.js build directory
npm run clean
```

For a more thorough cleanup before deployment or committing to version control:

```bash
# Remove node_modules (will need to run npm install again after)
rm -rf node_modules
npm run clean
```

This helps reduce the project size significantly when sharing or deploying.
